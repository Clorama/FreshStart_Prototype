      <p><i><b>FAQ: What is the fastest way to get a certified copy of a certificate?</b><br>
The fastest way to obtain a certificate is to go to a Vital Statistics office located in Anchorage or Juneau. If filled out correctly, many requests can be processed while you wait. However, some requests may take up to 48 hours to complete. Please note that not all certificates are available at the Anchorage office.
